/** Class to provide simple access to I2C EEPROM chiles like Microchip's 24LC range
 *  or AMTELS AT24C range.
 *  Chips up to 64Kb in size are directly supported.
 *  The class handles multiple page writes so any amount of data can be written in
 *  a single call to write. The writes are not buffered so additional memory use 
 *  is kept to a minimum.
 * 
 *  Although not tested it should work with the MAC versions of Microchip range
 *  as well but the chipSize will need to be set to include the ROM area as well.
